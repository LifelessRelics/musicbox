MusicBox - music theory framework for the analysis of music in rust
/// The future of this crate resides mostly in the analysis of musical data
/// Feeding a music AI
/// More bold would be to create a VST
/// ZootAllures is a reference to Frank Zappa
/// ZA notation is for the simplification of INTERVALS which remain constant
/// All contributions welcome, love to see how it plays out.
/// The solution to the brain and quantum theory likely lives in these strings.
